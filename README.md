# computational-cognitive-neuroscience
Final Project for the computational cognitive neuroscience course (SOW-MKI49)

## Project
[Jonas & Kording](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/26/055624) have applied popular data analysis methods from neuroscience to a simulated computer chip and showed that these methods don't reveal the hierarchy of information processing on the chip. They concluded that these methods might then also not be a very good fit for neuroscience. In this project, I will apply similar methods to a Policy Gradient Network trained on simple game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe), since a neural network might be more representative of the human brain than a computer chip.
